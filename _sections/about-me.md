I'm a Machine Learning Engineer with a passion for learning about and exploring Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning techniques. Iâ€™ve been fascinated with the field since first coming across it whilst studying Engineering at the University of Oxford, and I recently left my job in Finance to pursue a career in the industry. I started this website to showcase some of the work that I have completed and to write blog posts on AI related topics. If you want to get in touch with me you can reach me on [Linkedin](https://linkedin.com/in/Rees).
