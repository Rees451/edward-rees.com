I'm an MRes student on UCL's CDT for AI enabled Healthcare, jointly supervised by [Dr. Ken Li](https://iris.ucl.ac.uk/iris/browse/profile?upi=KLIXX57) (Institute of Health Informatics) and [Prof. Jun Wang](http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/Jun.Wang/) (Computer Science). I am particulary interested in deep learning, generative models and reinforcement learning and am currently working on applications of these to diabetes management (glucose prediction and control).

As an undergraduate I studied Engineering Science at the University of Oxford where I specialised in machine learning and biomedical modelling. My Master's thesis focused on developing a computational model of the vasculature of the brain to study the effect of vasomotion on oxygen perfusion.

I graduated from Oxford in 2018 and subsequently went on to work in finance at the Macquarie Group, where, amongst other things, I worked on the [buyout of KCOM](https://www.macquarie.com/uk/en/about/news/2019/macquarie-infrastructure-and-real-assets-finalises-acquisition-of-kcom-group.html). After this stint I decided to return to Engineering to work in machine learning R&D.

At Oxford I was involved in the Lightweight Rowing and Athletic clubs (serving as treasurer at the latter) and, whilst not nearly as fast as I once was, I still try to hang onto some of my athletic ability - these days when I'm not messing around at my computer I enjoy cyling and running.
