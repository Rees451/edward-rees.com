I'm an Engineer with a broad interest in all things Computer Science, Machine Learning and Statistics. As an undergraduate I studied Engineering Science at the University of Oxford where I specialised in Machine Learning and Biomedical Modelling. My Master's thesis focused on developing a computational model of the vasculature of the brain to study the effect of Vasomotion on oxygen perfusion.

I graduated from Oxford in 2018 and subsequently went on to work in Finance at the Macquarie Group, where, amongst other things, I worked on the [buyout of KCOM](https://www.macquarie.com/uk/en/about/news/2019/macquarie-infrastructure-and-real-assets-finalises-acquisition-of-kcom-group.html). After this stint in Finance I decided to return to Engineering to work in Machine Learning R&D. I am currently working as a Machine Learning Intern at [Speechmatics](https://www.speechmatics.com/about-us/) in their Advanced Machine Learning team.

 At Oxford I was involved in the Lightweight Rowing and Athletic clubs and, whilst not nearly as fast as I once was, I still try to hang onto some of my athletic ability. When I'm not messing around at my computer I enjoy training on my bike, in the pool, on foot and more recently at the climbing wall!
