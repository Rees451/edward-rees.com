  I'm a Machine Learning Engineer with a passion for learning about and exploring
  Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning techniques. Iâ€™ve been fascinated
  with the field since first coming across it whilst studying Engineering
  at the University of Oxford, and I recently left my job in Finance to pursue a
  career in the industry. I started this website to showcase some of the work
  that I have completed and to write blog posts on AI related topics. If you
  want to get in touch with me you can reach me on <a href='http://www.linkedin.com/in/Rees'>Linkedin</a>.
