<p>I’ve been fascinated with Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning since first coming across the field whilst studying Engineering at the University of Oxford. Since graduating I’ve become keenly aware of the huge impact that developments in AI and ML will have on human civilisation in the next century. Since graduating university I had been working at an Infrastructure fund but my belief in the rising importance and massive potential of AI and ML has ultimately led me to move back into Engineering and pursue a career in Data Science. To that end I am currently undertaking a Data Science bootcamp at General Assembly and I am excited to be starting my journey in this field.</p>
