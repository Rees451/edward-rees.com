  I've been working on a chatbot to provide people with cooking ideas and recipes.
  The idea for this project arose because whilst I quite enjoy cooking I often struggle 
  to come up with good ideas or recipes to cook. 
  Additionally, I often don't end up thinking about what to cook until I am in the supermarket, by which time it is too late to do a proper search.
  Therefore I made this chatbot to try and assist me in finding recipes. I am a big fan of <a href=https://mobkitchen.co.uk>MobKitchen</a> so they were the first set of recipes that I added to the bot. 
  However I hope to add some other sites in the future.
</p>

  The bot is still very much in development and hence runs locally on my computer. However, if the server is running you should see a blue chat icon in the bottom right hand corner. 
  Feel free to try it out! The source code and more explanation is on my <a href=https://github.com/erees1/recipe-chatbot>GitHub</a>. Note that it is not yet very good at handling deviations for the happy path!
