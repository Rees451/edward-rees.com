Hello! I'm Ed. I currently work as a Software Engineer at [Apollo Research](https://www.apolloresearch.ai/) where I build software for evaluations of LLM agents. I previously worked on the problem of [faithfull chain-of-thought reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05518) as an external contractor for Anthropic and as part of the SERI MATS programme.

Before getting into AI Safety I was a Senior Machine Learning Engineer at [Speechmatics](https://www.speechmatics.com) where I led a team working on representation learning in the audio domain. We think we have the best speech recognition in the world (you can try it out free [here](https://portal.speechmatics.com/signup)).

If you want to get in touch you can reach me at edward [dot] r [dot] rees [at] gmail [dot] [com].
