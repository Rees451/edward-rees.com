Hello! I'm Ed, I'm a Member of Technical Staff at [Anthropic](https://anthropic.com). Previously I worked as a Software Engineer at [Apollo Research](https://www.apolloresearch.ai/) where I built software for evaluations of LLM agents. I have also worked on the problem of [faithful chain-of-thought reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05518) as an external contractor for Anthropic and as part of the [MATS](https://www.matsprogram.org/) programme.

Prior to that I was a Senior Machine Learning Engineer at [Speechmatics](https://www.speechmatics.com) where I led a team working on representation learning in the audio domain. We think we have the best speech recognition in the world (you can try it out free [here](https://portal.speechmatics.com/signup)).

If you want to get in touch you can reach me at edward.r.rees[at]gmail.com.
