<p>
  I've been working on a chatbot to provide people with cooking ideas and
  recipes. The idea for this project arose because whilst I quite enjoy cooking
  I often struggle to come up with good ideas or recipes to cook. Additionally,
  I often don't end up thinking about what to cook until I am in the
  supermarket, by which time it is too late to do a proper search. Therefore I
  made this chatbot to try and assist me in finding recipes. I am a big fan of
  <a href="https://mobkitchen.co.uk">MobKitchen</a>
  so they were the first set of recipes that I added to the bot. However I hope
  to add some other sites in the future.
</p>
<p>
  The bot is still very much in development and hence runs locally on my
  computer. However, if the server is running you should see a blue chat icon in
  the bottom right hand corner. Feel free to try it out! The source code and
  more explanation is on my
  <a href="https://github.com/erees1/recipe-chatbot">GitHub</a>
  . Note that it is not yet very good at handling deviations for the happy path!
