Hello! I'm Ed. I am [currently working](https://github.com/erees1/cot-transparency) on AI safety research as an external contractor for Anthropic and as part of the SERI MATS extension programme.

I was previously a Senior Machine Learning Engineer @ [Speechmatics](https://www.speechmatics.com) where I led a team working on representation learning in the audio domain. We think we have the best speech recognition in the world (you can try it out free [here](https://portal.speechmatics.com/signup)).

If you want to get in touch you can reach me at edward dot r dot rees at gmail dot com.
